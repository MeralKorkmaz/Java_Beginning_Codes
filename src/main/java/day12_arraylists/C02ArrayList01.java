        Array List is used to store  multiple data with flexible length.
         We have to declare length when we create Arrays. This casuses problems in some occasions.
        Java created a new structure to overcome this problem....> Array List
        Arrays store primitive data and references but Array list store non-primitive data.
        Arrays are faster than array list and occupied lesser memory
        Why Java did not remove Arrays because Arrays are faster and Arrays use memory less
